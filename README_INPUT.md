# Hello!

Thank you for taking the time to do Depop’s coding test 🙏.

This project aims to catch keyword spamming 🍖 — when sellers list large numbers of unrelated or irrelevant keywords in an item’s description to boost its ranking in search results 📈. For example, a buyer searching for “Levi jeans” 👖 might see Diesel jeans ⛽️ ranked highly, simply because the word “Levi” was spammed in the description. This is frustrating for the buyer 😖.

Here are examples of product descriptions with keyword spam:

```
Low waist/rise diesel bootcut/flared jeans. Size XS/6. Great condition. Cool red stitching details.
Message for any questions :) UK shipping only
No returns
#vintage #diesel #denim #lowrise #levi #wrangler #lee #y2k #90s #2010s #blue #black #faded
```

```

If we can classify item descriptions as ‘spammy’ 🍖, we can demote those items in the ranking algorithm 📉. This project is focused on building that classifier 🔨.

This test imagines you’re working alongside a junior data scientist who has already put together an initial model. They’ve shared a notebook with their code. Normally, you might review and give feedback to coach them - but in this case, you should take over the work and bring it up to your high standards 🏆.

Your goal is to identify flaws in the current approach and fix the most impactful issues - within the time you can allocate to the task.

As you’ll see, there are a bunch of issues:
	•	Some errors in ML logic 🔬
	•	Badly tuned model
	•	Limited features
	•	Lack of structure 🏗 (likely because it’s all in a notebook)
	•	Un-Pythonic patterns
	•	And generally, it needs a lot of improvement 🛠

There’s too much here to perfect everything in one go, so focus on the improvements that matter most. At the end, let us know what you’d do next if you had more time ⏰, and suggest logical next steps for the project 🧗🏿‍♀️.

After you submit your work, we’ll schedule a follow-up interview where you can walk us through your thinking and decisions.

NB: The code has been tested with Python 3.11, but feel free to use any Python 3 version you prefer.
